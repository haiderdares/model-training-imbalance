Handling Imbalanced Datasets in Environmental, Ecological, and Health Studies

Introduction

Imbalanced datasets are a prevalent challenge in fields like environmental science, ecology, and health studies, where critical problems often hinge on detecting rare events or minority classes. Examples include identifying endangered species, predicting disease outbreaks, and spotting environmental anomalies. In these cases, the underrepresentation of crucial minority classes presents unique difficulties for data analysis and model accuracy. For instance, misclassifying rare diseases or environmental threats can have significant real-world consequences.

Addressing the issues related to imbalanced datasets, such as biased model predictions and poor minority class detection, is essential to improving the reliability of predictions in these areas. This project aims to address these issues and enhance model performance when working with imbalanced data.

Research Objective

The objective of this project is to develop a structured, step-by-step pipeline to handle imbalanced datasets specifically tailored for environmental, ecological, and health studies. Our approach aims to enhance model performance by focusing on rare event detection for both classification and regression tasks.

Key Goals
Improve Model Performance: Enhance the accuracy and reliability of minority class detection, especially for rare event prediction.
Comprehensive Coverage: Develop a pipeline that supports both classification,regression and  problems.
Effective Techniques: Apply various imbalance handling techniques to improve model outcomes.
